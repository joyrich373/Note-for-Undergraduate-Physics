1.The main.pdf file is my note for physics (not yet finished typing) which listed textbooks I used for self-studying physics.
Since most textbooks I use for studying mathematics are in Chinese, I will not list them here.

2.The course description.pdf file is a fine description for my undergraduate core courses. 
Notice: I seldom learn from school courses. The description shows what the school taught, not what I learned. 
What I managed to learn about these topics are beyond the school plan, otherwise, I cannot learn GR and QFT on my own.
